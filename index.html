      <H1>About</H1>
      <p>
         The Somerville Metro Lions Club was conceived in the spring of 2007 when then-District 16D Vice Governor Tony Aba√±o and Larry Massaro, who served as guiding Lions, met with Ray Tigol, Rogel Bautista, Jack Domider and Prospero Tayco and discussed the formation of a Lions Club in Somerville, NJ. The club was formed with 26 members, with Ray Tigol becoming the charter president. As a new Club, SMLC started being one of the first clubs of District 16D with family membership, i.e., husbands and wives joining together.
         <br>
         SMLC celebrated its Charter Night & Induction last January 26, 2008 at the Bridgewater Manor located in Route 202/206 Bridgewater, New Jersey. The event was attended by officers of Mulitple District 16 of New Jersey Lions and guests from the local government. As part of this historic affair, the Club published a souvenir journal.
